## LAB ASSIGNMENT 07
## 🎯 Objective
To analyze and visualize real-world datasets (Facebook and Heart Disease data) using various types of plots for insights and pattern discovery.

---

## 📁 Datasets Used
- **Facebook Posts Dataset** (`dataset_facebook.csv`)  
- **Heart Disease Dataset** (`heart.csv`)

---

## 📈 Visualizations Performed

### 📘 Facebook Dataset
1. **Bar Plot**  
   - Shows average post reach by type (e.g., photo, status).
2. **Box Plot**  
   - Visualizes the distribution of total interactions across categories.
3. **Scatter Plot**  
   - Compares post reach vs. total interactions.
4. **Line Plot**  
   - Displays average page likes per post month.

### ❤️ Heart Dataset
1. **Line Plot**  
   - Shows average maximum heart rate (`thalach`) across different ages.
2. **Bar Plot**  
   - Displays average cholesterol (`chol`) for different chest pain types.
3. **Box Plot**  
   - Shows distribution of cholesterol across chest pain types.
4. **Scatter Plot**  
   - Plots cholesterol vs. age, colored by heart disease presence.
